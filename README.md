NMU-Responsive
==============

This is a non-Drupal version of the Responsive NMU theme. It is basicly a source rip and conversion from the current site.  These template files were created to allow pages/sites outside of Drupal to use an "offical" version of the responsive theme.

This repository is managed by Eric Johnson in the Communications and Marketing office.  Updates made to any of the theme-level elements on the main NMU site will be duplicated here.  Questions about using this template or feature requests can be sent to ericjohn@nmu.edu.
